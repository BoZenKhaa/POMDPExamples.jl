    "We begin by implementing the type that represents the model itself. First, some notes about the Crying Baby POMDP:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The *state* is a Boolean value representing whether the baby is hungry\n",
    "- The *action* is a Boolean indicateting whether the agent is feeding the baby\n",
    "- The *observation* is a Boolean indicating whether the baby is crying\n",
    "- When the baby is hungry, it cries with a high probability and cries with a low probability when it is full\n",
    "- When the baby is fed, it immediately becomes full.\n",
    "- At each step, the baby has a small probability of becoming hungry.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `BabyPOMDP` model type is a subtype of the [`POMDP`](http://juliapomdp.github.io/POMDPs.jl/latest/api.html#POMDPs.POMDP) abstract type. `POMDP` has three parameters which indicate the types used to represent the state, action, and observation respectively, which are all `Bool` in this case. The type also includes parameters that will be used in the reward and transition definitions."
